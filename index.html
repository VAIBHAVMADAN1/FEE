      <p>
        Sir Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, England.
        He came from a family of farmers but displayed exceptional aptitude in
        mathematics and science from a young age.

      <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
      <p>Newton's most significant contributions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Formulating the laws of motion, which laid the foundation for
          classical mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developing the law of universal gravitation, explaining the motion of
          celestial bodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inventing calculus independently, a fundamental branch of mathematics.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Sir Isaac Newton's work revolutionized science and mathematics, shaping
        the way we understand the physical world. His laws of motion and
        universal gravitation remain fundamental principles in physics. His
        legacy continues to inspire scientists and scholars worldwide.

      "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both
      true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose, the
      philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain
      when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects
      not the pomp of superfluous causes." - Principia
